        """One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He
lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he
could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed
ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared
with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
"What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a
proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread
out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it
there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted
out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather."""

some of  them. We had what we called microscopes and ultramicroscopes,
and we put  them to our eyes and looked through them, so that we saw
things larger  than they really were, and many things we could not see
without the  microscopes at all. Our best ultramicroscopes could make a
germ look  forty thousand times larger. A mussel-shell is a thousand
fingers like  Edwin's. Take forty mussel-shells, and by as many times
larger was the  germ when we looked at it through a microscope. And
after that, we  had other ways, by using what we called moving pictures,
of making the  forty-thousand-times germ many, many thousand times
larger still. And  thus we saw all these things which our eyes of
themselves could not see.  Take a grain of sand. Break it into ten pieces.
Take one piece and break  it into ten. Break one of those pieces into
ten, and one of those into  ten, and one of those into ten, and one of
those into ten, and do it all  day, and maybe, by sunset, you will have
a piece as small as one of the  germs." The boys were openly incredulous.
Hare-Lip sniffed and sneered  and Hoo-Hoo snickered, until Edwin nudged
them to be silent."""

station, and asked the conductor, "Are you going to start?" "At once,
madam." "But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers&mdash;" "I
cannot interrupt the trip," replied the conductor.  "We are already
three hours behind time." "And when will another train pass here from
San Francisco?" "To-morrow evening, madam." "To-morrow evening!  But
then it will be too late!  We must wait&mdash;" "It is impossible,"

not go," said Aouda. Fix had heard this conversation. """

Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through
civilised community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was
not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was
even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the
extermination of our invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state
of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death. It was nearly
eleven when I started to return."""

on: 'But  why did they live at the bottom of a well?' 'Take some more
